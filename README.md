### Overview about Time Series

#### Question: What is time Series Data?
#### Answer: Sequential ordered data over time is called time series data
    * Observations are typically collected at regular intervals
        * Every Second/Minute/Hourly
        * Daily
        * Monthly
        * Quarterly/Yearly
    * Examples:
        * Monthly Sales Data
        * Quarterly/Annual Revenue
        * Hourly Weather Data/Wind Speed
        * IOT Sensor in Industries and Smart Devies 
        * Energy Forecasting 
        etc...

#### Key Concepths
    * Data May have some Trends
    * Data may have some Seasonality
    * Data may be Cyclic
    (Note: There is difference between Seasonality and Cyclic Data)
    * Data can be Non-Stationary but some of the modeling techniques supposed to be data in Stationary.

In Cyclic we can't predict the nature but in seasonality we can predict it... like in some season the sales of sweets increased but items like gold have no seasonality pattern on price.

### Types of Seasonality 
    * Additive Sesonality with No Trend
    * Additive Seasonality With Trend
    * Multiplicative Seasonality With No Trend
    * Multiplicative Seasonality With Trend
